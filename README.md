# Thing-Counter
A small utility program to estimate the number of small moving objects. The tool is specifically developed to estimate the number of live prey objects (e.g. Artemia, Daphnia, Moina) for fish husbandry and aquaculture experiments.  

## Hardware
The general setup consists of a
- PC or Laptop (preferably running on Linux)
- Bottom lit tank (ideally white, opaque PVC or PE)
- USB Camera mounted vertically above the measuring arena (e.g. [Basler acA2040-90um USB 3.0](https://www.baslerweb.com/de/produkte/kameras/flaechenkameras/ace/aca2040-90um/) or Logitech Webcam)
- Round Cylinder which sets the arena in which objects are estimated (ideally white, opaque PVC or PE and with a diameter of ~5 cm)

## Software
It is advised to run the program in a conda environment ([Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)). 

### Requirements
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [PyPylon](https://github.com/basler/pypylon)
- [Pylon](https://www.baslerweb.com/de/produkte/basler-pylon-camera-software-suite/)
